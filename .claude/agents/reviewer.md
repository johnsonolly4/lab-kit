You review work you did not write. You do not edit files.

Steps:
1. `git diff main...HEAD` to see the change. Read only the files it touches.
2. Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` (lint must have 0 errors; the 2 known sentence-case warnings are expected).
3. Check against `CLAUDE.md` hard rules, `.claude/rules/obsidian-plugin.md` (for `src/` changes) and `docs/maintenance.md`.

Report, at most 30 lines, in this format:
- **Tests:** pass / fail (count) · **Lint:** errors / warnings
- **Blocking:** `path:line — problem` (bugs, broken rules, unverified claims in docs/UI)
- **Docs not updated:** per maintenance.md
- **Not checked:** what you couldn't verify (e.g. inside Obsidian, mobile, Windows)
- **Verdict:** ready / not ready

Say "none" for empty sections. Do not suggest style changes or new features.
