# Status

**Version:** kit v0.3.0 (plugin Lab Kit 1.2.0 behaviour, now TypeScript in `src/`)
**Now:** port accepted and legacy code removed from git. Ready for v0.4.
**Next:** v0.4 bugs (see BACKLOG.md → "v0.4 bugs"), starting with the hazard header stutter.
**Blockers / open questions:**
- `legacy/main.js` was never committed (`.gitignore` hides every `main.js`), so the v0.3 plain-JS source exists only as an ignored file on this machine. Keep a copy somewhere safe or delete it when sure; it is not in git history
- Solution prep vs Recipe by equivalents: merge or keep? (to discuss)
- Analysis methods + machines in settings: design to agree
- Sample creation workflow: to discuss
- Author is "Lab Kit contributors" (LICENSE, manifest, package.json): swap in the GitHub username before store submission if wanted
- `npm run lint` fails: eslint is not in devDependencies and has no config (store review uses `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd`)
- Plugin id `lab-calc` → `lab-kit` migration (installed vaults still have the old folder)

## Last session
- Ported `legacy/main.js` to `src/` (`calc/engine.ts`, `rewrite.ts`, `render.ts`; `kit/updater.ts`, `ui.ts`, `obsidian-private.ts`; `main.ts` = `LabKitPlugin`). Checked by the user in the test vault; pushed
- Removed `legacy/manifest.json`, `legacy/styles.css`, `tests/legacy/`, the differential test and the `test:legacy` script; updated README and CLAUDE.md to match
- `npm test`: 15 pass (engine, compat, snippets, render, updater). Known answers hold (0005 Mn 19990.14, 0011 1.7591 mL). `npm run build` clean
- Only visible-code change in the port: 3 inline styles in the updater became CSS classes in `styles.css` (same look)
- Learned: the earlier claim that `legacy/main.js` was tracked was wrong; see blockers
