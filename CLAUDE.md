# Lab Kit

Obsidian plugin + vault kit for a chemistry PhD lab notebook.
Features: live ```` ```calc ```` tables, Alt+S snippet forms (Templater), hazard/data-folder header, built-in kit (templates + scripts, updated with the plugin).
Listed in the Obsidian community plugin store (since 2026-10-04); every release goes through the store review.

## Session routine (MANDATORY, no exceptions)
**Start:** read `STATUS.md`. Say in one line which task you are taking. If unsure, ask one question.
**Work:** one task per session. More than 2 files will change → plan mode first, wait for approval, work in phases.
**End** (you cannot run `/clear`; only the user can):
1. `npm test` and `npm run lint` (0 errors). Nothing is done until they pass.
2. Update docs per `docs/maintenance.md`.
3. Update `STATUS.md` (≤ 40 lines; the Version line only changes at release). Anything left unchanged or unfinished (skipped on purpose, out of scope, not verified) → `BACKLOG.md` as an unticked item with file:line pointers; STATUS just points to it.
4. Commit on the feature branch.
5. Run `/handoff`. Then **STOP**: don't start the next task, even if it is obvious or small. End your reply with exactly:
   > [!done] Task finished
   > Type `/clear`, then say **Read STATUS.md and continue**.

If the user asks for another task without clearing, remind them to `/clear` first, once, then do what they decide.

## Commands
- Tests: `npm test` (vitest, failures only) · Lint: `npm run lint` · Build: `npm run build`
- Run: `npm run dev` (watch build into `test-vault/.obsidian/plugins/lab-kit/`)
- After editing anything in `kit/`: `npm run kit:manifest`

## Hard rules
- Never read or write the user's real vault. Only `test-vault/`.
- Never push, merge to `main`, tag, release or delete without asking.
- Plugin code follows `.claude/rules/obsidian-plugin.md` (loads automatically for `src/`); it must work on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile (`hasNode()`).
- Engine changes need a test against fixtures. Known answers: 0005 RAFT Mn = 19990.14; 0011 reactor volume = 1.7591 mL.
- Do only what was asked. Don't change user-facing text, layout or defaults beyond the task: ask first. Anything else you notice → `BACKLOG.md`, and mention it.
- Follow the conventions already in the code. Don't reformat or reorganise files you aren't changing.
- Lab vocabulary is the user's: keep their names (Exp. Class, CoSHH, RA, sample codes like ABC0014-A).
- **The version only moves at release** (it is not a commit counter). Only `/release` touches the version fields (`package.json` + lock, `manifest.json`, `kit/kit-manifest.json`, `versions.json`), and only the user picks a bump. `tests/versions.test.ts` fails if they differ.
- Public repo: no real names, initials or real paths in any file. The GitHub username is fine (repo URL, commit author). Paths and personal values belong in plugin settings (empty defaults); the user's vault path goes in `.claude/settings.local.json` (not committed).
- Make claims (docs, UI text, reports) only from measured results. Say what was not verified (e.g. "not seen in Obsidian").
- If the user's short reply could answer more than one open question, say which one you think it answers before acting.
- Multi-line edits: use the Edit tool, not escaped shell scripts.

## Terse commands
- "continue" → top item in `STATUS.md` → Next
- "push" → push the current branch and open a PR with `gh pr create`
- "merge" → merge the open PR for this branch
- "release" → `/release` · user feedback → `/feedback` (→ `BACKLOG.md`)

## Where things are
Read only what the request needs: `docs/INDEX.md` says which file covers what; `docs/architecture.md` is the code map.
Searching the code: use the `explorer` agent. Long test or log output: run it in a subagent.

## Models
Default Sonnet; Opus only for design decisions and root-cause hunts. Agents are pinned in `.claude/agents/`.

## Talking to the user
- Short, scannable answers: summary first, bullets over paragraphs.
- Ask decisions as multiple-choice questions with a recommended option.
- Notes and docs for their vault use Obsidian Markdown: callouts, `$…$` LaTeX, Mermaid, [[wikilinks]].
